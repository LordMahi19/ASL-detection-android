## Introduction

This project showcases the implementation of hand landmark detection using machine learning models on an Android platform. It provides a real-time hand tracking experience by identifying key points on the hand and predicting sign language characters.

## Features

- Real-time hand landmark detection
- Sign language character prediction
- Easy integration with Android applications
- High accuracy and performance

## Requirements

- Android Studio 4.0 or higher
- Android device with camera support
- Minimum SDK version 21

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand_landmarker_android.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Sync the project with Gradle files.
4. Build and run the application on your Android device.
5. You can download the apk test out the app from this [link](https://lut-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/mahi_talukder_student_lut_fi/EZM8m7IetShMolTYPE6DPXkBfAM3Nop4aV7j66AOvOqwPA?e=d9qYmi)

## Usage

1. Launch the application on your Android device.
2. Grant camera permissions if prompted.
3. Point the camera at your hand to see real-time hand landmark detection and sign language character prediction.
4. Sign language chatachters for practice:
